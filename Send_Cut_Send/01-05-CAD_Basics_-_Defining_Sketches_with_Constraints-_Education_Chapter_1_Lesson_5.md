## Outline

### Introduction to Constraints
- Constraints are the "rules" of CAD that prevent chaos
- Constraints keep sketches from falling apart over time
- Located in the constraints drawer within the Fusion toolbox

### Goal: Fully Defined Sketches
- The objective is to create fully defined sketches
- Fully defined features turn black instead of blue
- Blue color indicates undefined/chaotic elements
- Black color indicates fully constrained elements

### Constraint Types and Applications

#### Parallel Constraint
- Makes two lines parallel to each other
- First selected line drives the orientation of the second
- Lines remain blue (undefined) but maintain parallel relationship
- Can move lines anywhere while keeping them parallel

#### Horizontal/Vertical Constraint
- Forces a line to be perfectly horizontal or vertical
- Uses 45-degree rule: lines >45° become vertical, <45° become horizontal
- Only requires selecting one line
- When combined with parallel constraint, affects both lines

#### Coincident Constraint
- Based on points, not lines
- Attaches one point to another point
- Can attach sketch elements to origin or other reference points
- Partially defines elements (some parts turn black, others remain blue)

#### Equal Constraint
- Makes two lines equal in length
- Requires selecting two lines
- Creates relationship where changing one line's length affects the other
- Both lines maintain equal length automatically

#### Midpoint Constraint
- Places a point at the exact middle of a line
- Requires selecting a point and a line
- Point snaps to the center of the selected line
- Maintains midpoint relationship when line length changes

#### Perpendicular Constraint
- Makes two lines perpendicular (90-degree angle)
- Requires selecting two lines
- Significantly restricts movement options
- Lines can only move up/down and change length, not left/right

### Constraint Interaction and Power
- Multiple constraints work together in the background
- Two constraints can control three or more features
- Constraints build upon each other to create complex relationships
- Each constraint reduces degrees of freedom

### Visual Indicators
- Blue color = undefined/chaotic elements
- Black color = fully defined elements
- White dots = free-floating points
- Black dots = constrained points

### Next Steps
- Dimensions are needed to fully define sketches
- Constraints alone are not sufficient for complete definition
- Dimensions will be covered in the next lesson

### Terms
- **Constraint** – A rule in CAD that defines relationships between sketch elements
- **Fully Defined Sketch** – A sketch where all elements are black, indicating complete constraint
- **Parallel Constraint** – Forces two lines to remain parallel to each other
- **Horizontal/Vertical Constraint** – Forces a line to be perfectly horizontal or vertical
- **Coincident Constraint** – Attaches one point to another point
- **Equal Constraint** – Makes two lines equal in length
- **Midpoint Constraint** – Places a point at the exact middle of a line
- **Perpendicular Constraint** – Forces two lines to meet at a 90-degree angle
- **45-Degree Rule** – The rule that determines whether a line becomes horizontal or vertical based on its current angle

## Master Answer Key

1. B – Black color indicates fully defined elements, while blue indicates undefined elements.

2. A – Constraints are essential rules that prevent chaos in CAD sketches and cannot be ignored.

3. C – The first line selected determines the orientation that the second line will adopt.

4. D – The 45-degree rule determines whether a line becomes horizontal (<45°) or vertical (>45°) when using the horizontal/vertical constraint.

5. D – The horizontal/vertical constraint only requires selecting one line, unlike parallel, equal, and perpendicular constraints which require two selections.

6. C – The coincident constraint works specifically with points, allowing you to attach one point to another.

7. B – The equal constraint creates a relationship where both lines maintain the same length automatically.

8. C – The midpoint constraint places a point at the exact middle of a line, as the name suggests.

9. B – The perpendicular constraint restricts movement significantly, allowing only vertical movement and length changes.

10. C – The main goal of applying constraints is to create a fully defined sketch where all elements are properly constrained.

11. A – Blue-colored elements indicate undefined/chaotic elements, not fully constrained ones.

12. C – Two constraints (parallel and horizontal) were used to control three features (both lines being parallel, both being horizontal).

13. B – Fully defined elements turn black, indicating they are properly constrained.

14. D – The coincident constraint is used to attach points together, such as attaching a sketch point to the origin.

15. B – Constraints alone are not sufficient; dimensions are also needed to fully define a sketch.
